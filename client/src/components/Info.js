          <b>Electoral Bonds</b>
        </h2>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Electoral bonds were a mode of funding for political parties in
            India from their introduction in 2017 until they were struck down as
            unconstitutional by the Supreme Court on 15 February 2024.
          </strong>{" "}
          Following their termination, a five-judge bench headed by the Chief
          Justice directed the State Bank of India to cede the identities and
          other details of donors and recipients to the Election Commission of
          India, which was in turn asked to publish them on its website.
        </p>
        <p>
          The course of action was introduced in The Finance Bill, 2017 during
          the Union Budget 2017-18 by then Finance Minister Arun Jaitley. They
          were classified as a Money Bill, and thus bypassed certain
          parliamentary scrutiny processes, in what was alleged to be a
          violation of Article 110 of Indian constitution. Mr Jaitley also
          proposed to amend the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Act in order to
          facilitate the issuance of electoral bonds by banks for the purpose of
          political funding.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although introduced in early 2017, the Department of Economic Affairs
          in Ministry Of Finance notified the Electoral Bond Scheme 2018 in a
          Gazette only on 2 January 2018. According to an estimate, a total of
          18,299 electoral bonds equivalent to a monetary value of ₹9,857 crore
          (98.57 billion) were successfully transacted during the period
          spanning from March 2018 to April 2022.
        </p>
        <p>
          On 7 November 2022, the Electoral Bond scheme was amended to increase
          the sale days from 70 to 85 in a year where any assembly election may
          be scheduled. The decision on Electoral Bond (Amendment) Scheme, 2022
          was taken shortly prior to the assembly elections in Gujarat and
          Himachal Pradesh, while the Model Code of Conduct was implemented in
          both the states.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ahead of the 2019 General Elections, Congress announced its intention
          to eliminate electoral bonds, if the party is elected to power. The
          Communist Party of India (Marxist) has also opposed the scheme, and
          was the sole national party to refuse donations through electoral
          bonds.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            On 15 February 2024, a five-judge bench of the Supreme Court of
            India, headed by Chief Justice DY Chandrachud, unanimously struck
            down the electoral bonds scheme, as well as amendments to the
            Representation of People Act, Companies Act and Income Tax Act, as
            unconstitutional.

          They found it "violative of RTI (Right to Information)" and of voters’
          right to information about political funding under Article 19(1)(a) of
          the Constitution. They also pointed out that it "would lead to quid
          pro quo arrangements" between corporations and politicians.
        </p>
        <p>
          The State Bank of India was asked to hand over details of donors and
          recipients to the Election Commission of India by March 6, and the ECI
          was to publish these online by March 13. However, the SBI failed to
          submit the details by March 6, and approached the Supreme Court asking
          for more time. The court turned down this request, following which the
          details were turned over to the ECI and published on their website.

        <h3>
          <b>Features</b>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Electoral Bonds functioned like Promissory notes and interest-free
          banking tools. Any Indian citizen or organization registered in India
          could buy these bonds after fulfilling the KYC norms laid down by the
          Reserve Bank of India (RBI). They could be procured by a donor solely
          through the means of cheque or digital payments in various
          denominations, such as one thousand, ten thousand, one lakh, ten lakh,
          and one crore from specific branches of the State Bank of India (SBI).
          Within a span of 15 days of issuance, these electoral bonds could be
          redeemed in the designated account of a legally registered political
          party under the Representation of the People Act, 1951 (u/s 29A) which
          had received at least 1% of the votes in the last election. The
          stanches of bonds were available for purchase for 10 days in the
          months of January, April, July, and October with an additional
          time-frame of 30 days in the year of general elections for Lok Sabha.
        </p>
        <p>
          Electoral bonds featured anonymity since they bore no identification
          of the donor and the political party to which they were issued. In the
          event that the 15-day deadline was not met, neither the donor nor the
          receiving political party received a refund for the issued electoral
          bonds. Rather, the fund value of the electoral bond was remitted to
          the Prime Minister's National Relief Fund (PMNRF).
        </p>

        <h3>
          <b>Objective</b>
        </h3>
        <p>
          The government capped cash donations to political parties at ₹2,000.
          Enforcing donation amount exceeding ₹2,000 via the banking system
          would mean the declaration of assets by political parties and also
          enable their traceability. Then Finance Minister Arun Jaitley argued
          that this reform of electoral bonds is expected to enhance
          transparency and accountability in the realm of political funding,
          while also preventing the creation of illegal funds for future
          generations. Jaitley, while defending the anonymity of bonds, argued
          that if donors were asked to disclose their identity, they would
          revert back to cash donations. The anonymity of the bonds was also
          intended to protect the donors' privacy and shield them from potential
          harassment.
        </p>

        <h3>
          <b>Timeline</b>
        </h3>
        <p>
          On 28 January 2017, the finance ministry in a correspondence with the
          Reserve Bank of India (RBI) sought comments on the proposed amendments
          in The Finance Bill, 2017. The necessity of amendments to RBI Act was
          realized. Next day, on 30 January 2017, the RBI replied by expressing
          its severe apprehensions, contending that the electoral bond scheme
          was susceptible to illicit financial activities, lack of transparency,
          and possible exploitation. HuffPost India reported that the government
          overlooked the RBI concerns and went ahead with its announcement
          during Budget Session in Parliament on 1 February 2017.
        </p>

        <h3>Impact on Existing Regulations</h3>
        <p>
          The monetary contribution limit that any registered political party in
          India can receive from an individual has been restricted to ₹2,000 –
          representing a reduction to 10% of the previous threshold of ₹20,000.
          This was done through the Finance Act, 2017.
        </p>
        <p>
          Introduction of electoral bonds has effectively abolished the ceiling
          on contributions made by corporations, which was earlier limited to
          7.5% of the organization's average net earnings over the preceding
          three-year period. An amendment to the Companies Act, 2013 ensured
          this change.
        </p>
        <p>
          The scheme resulted in the elimination of the mandatory obligation for
          individuals or corporations to provide comprehensive information
          regarding their political contributions. Instead of reporting a
          comprehensive breakdown of political donations within their annual
          financial reports, companies would now be solely required to disclose
          a consolidated sum for purchase of electoral bonds. Relevant
          provisions under the Income Tax Act, 1961 were amended in this regard.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) was amended by the
          government, with the support of the opposition, to broaden the
          definition of a "foreign" entity, with the explicit aim of expanding
          the scope of firms that could lawfully make political contributions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Critics argued that these changes would allow any person, corporation,
          or interest group to now anonymously donate an unrestricted amount of
          funds to any political party, and that no citizen, journalist, or
          civil society representative would be able to establish any
          connections.
